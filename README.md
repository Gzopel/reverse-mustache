# reverse-mustache [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/reverse-mustache.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/reverse-mustache)

Reverse templating library for [mustache][], generating variables from a template's output

This was created to explore the untapped reverse templating domain. It was initially inspired by [@laktek's `extract-values` library][extract-values].

[mustache]: https://github.com/janl/mustache.js
[extract-values]: http://www.laktek.com/2012/10/04/extract-values-from-a-string/

```js
reverseMustache({
  template: 'hello {{#place}}world{{/place}}',
  content: 'hello world'
});
/*
{tokensByName: {world: true}}
*/
```

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install reverse-mustache`

```javascript
var reverse_mustache = require('reverse-mustache');
reverse_mustache.awesome(); // "awesome"
```

## Documentation
**Foreword**: The current implementation is quick and dirty to see if the project was possible.
